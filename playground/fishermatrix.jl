    $(SIGNATURES)

Compute the Fisher information matrix of a `model` transformed by `t` using the array configuration
`ac`. You can also optionally pass the `ad_type` as the last argument which is which
backend to `AbstractDifferentiation` you want to use to compute derivatives.

`model` is assumed to be a function that takes the `NamedTuple`, `θ` and returns
a `<:Stoked.AbstractModel` that coincides with the visibility model you want to consider.

This returns a `Tuple` where the first entry is Fisher information metric and the second
is distribution assuming that the mean is the transformed `θ` and the covariance matrix
is the inverse of the Fisher information.
