<p>Currently <code>Comrade</code> assumes that the field of view of small enough that ignoring telescope systematics, are given by the Fourier transform <span class="math display">ùí±(<em>u</em>,<em>v</em>)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ‚à´<em>e</em><sup>2<em>œÄ</em><em>i</em>(<em>u</em><em>Œ±</em>+<em>v</em><em>Œ≤</em>)</sup><em>I</em>(<em>Œ±</em>,<em>Œ≤</em>)d<em>Œ±</em>d<em>Œ≤</em>.</span></p>
<p><code>Gala</code> is an Astropy-affiliated Python package for galactic dynamics. Python enables wrapping low-level languages (e.g., C) for speed without losing flexibility or ease-of-use in the user-interface. The API for <code>Gala</code> was designed to provide a class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or Cython-optimized) implementations of common operations such as gravitational potential and force evaluation, orbit integration, dynamical transformations, and chaos indicators for nonlinear dynamics. <code>Gala</code> also relies heavily on and interfaces well with the implementations of physical units and astronomical coordinate systems in the <code>Astropy</code> package <span class="citation" data-cites="astropy">[@astropy]</span> (<code>astropy.units</code> and <code>astropy.coordinates</code>).</p>
<p><code>Gala</code> was designed to be used by both astronomical researchers and by students in courses on gravitational dynamics or astronomy. It has already been used in a number of scientific publications <span class="citation" data-cites="Pearson:2017">[@Pearson:2017]</span> and has also been used in graduate courses on Galactic dynamics to, e.g., provide interactive visualizations of textbook material <span class="citation" data-cites="Binney:2008">[@Binney:2008]</span>. The combination of speed, design, and support for Astropy functionality in <code>Gala</code> will enable exciting scientific explorations of forthcoming data releases from the <em>Gaia</em> mission <span class="citation" data-cites="gaia">[@gaia]</span> by students and experts alike.</p>

<p>Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g.¬†<span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ<em>e</em><sup><em>œÄ</em>/<em>x</em></sup></span></p>
<p>Double dollars make self-standing equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x &lt; 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$</span></p>
<p>You can also use plain for equations  and refer to  from text.</p>
