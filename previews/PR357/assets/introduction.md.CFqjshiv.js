The goal is to allow the user to easily combine and modify a set of primitive models to construct complicated source structures. The benefit of this approach is that it is straightforward to construct different source models out of these primitives. Namely, an end-user does not have to create a separate source &quot;model&quot; every time they change the model specification. Additionally, most models currently implemented are differentiable with at Zygote and sometimes ForwardDiff<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. This allows for gradient accelerated optimization and sampling (e.g., HMC) to be used with little effort by the end user. To sample from the posterior, we provide a somewhat barebones interface since, most of the time, and we don&#39;t require the additional features offered by most PPLs. Additionally, the overhead introduced by PPLs tends to be rather large. In the future, we may revisit this as Julia&#39;s PPL ecosystem matures.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Note</p><p>The primitives the Comrade defines, however, would allow for it to be easily included in PPLs like <a href="https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>Turing</code></a>.</p></div><h2 id="Tutorials" tabindex="-1">Tutorials <a class="header-anchor" href="#Tutorials" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tutorials {#Tutorials}&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Our tutorial section currently has a large number of examples.
