The goal is to allow the user to easily combine and modify a set of primitive models to construct complicated source structures. The benefit of this approach is that it is straightforward to construct different source models out of these primitives. Namely, an end-user does not have to create a separate source &quot;model&quot; every time they change the model specification. Additionally, most models currently implemented are differentiable with at Enzyme. This allows for gradient accelerated optimization and sampling (e.g., HMC) to be used with little effort by the end user.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Warn</p><p>As of 0.11 Comrade is only tested with Enzyme. ForwardDiff may work for some models, but it is not tested and there are known problems with e.g., closures due to the use of a sparse cholesky factorization. Additionally essentially no models will work with Zygote due to the heavy use of mutation in the codebase. The use of mutation is necessary for performance reasons, and we have no plans to change this in the future.</p></div><h2 id="tutorials" tabindex="-1">Tutorials <a class="header-anchor" href="#tutorials" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tutorials&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Our tutorial section currently has a large number of examples.
