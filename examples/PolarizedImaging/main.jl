# # Polarized Image and Instrumental Modeling

# In this tutorial, we will analyze a simulated simple polarized dataset to demonstrate
# Comrade's polarized imaging capabilities.

# ## Introduction to Polarized Imaging
# The EHT is a polarized interferometer. However, like all VLBI interferometers, it does not
# directly measure the Stokes parameters (I, Q, U, V). Instead, it measures components
# related to the electric field at the telescope along two *directions* using feeds.
# There are two types of feeds at telescopes: circular, which measure $R/L$ components of the
# electric field, and linear feeds, which measure $X/Y$ components of the electric field.
# Most sites in the EHT use circular feeds, meaning they measure the right (R) and left
# electric field (L) at each telescope. Although note that ALMA actually uses linear feeds.
# Currently Comrade has the ability to fit natively mixed polarization data however, the
# publically released EHT data has been converted to circular polarization.
# For a VLBI array whose feeds are purely circluar the **coherency matrices** are given by,
#
# ```math
#  C_{ij} = \begin{pmatrix}
#        RR^* &  RL^*\\
#        LR^* &  LL^*
#      \end{pmatrix}.
# ```
#
# These coherency matrices are the fundamental object in interferometry and what
# the telescope observes. For a perfect interferometer, these circular coherency matrices
# are related to the usual Fourier transform of the stokes parameters by
#
# ```math
#   \begin{pmatrix}
#       \tilde{I}\\ \tilde{Q} \\ \tilde{U} \\ \tilde{V}
#   \end{pmatrix}
#   =\frac{1}{2}
#   \begin{pmatrix}
#      RR^* + LL^* \\
#      RL^* + LR^* \\
#      i(LR^* - RL^*)\\
#      RR^* - LL^*
#   \end{pmatrix}.
# ```
#-
# !!! note
#     In this tutorial, we stick to circular feeds but Comrade has the capabilities
#     to model linear (XX,XY, ...) and mixed basis coherencies (e.g., RX, RY, ...).
#-
#
# In reality, the measure coherencies are corrupted by both the atmosphere and the
# telescope itself. In `Comrade` we use the RIME formalism [^1] to represent these corruptions,
# namely our measured coherency matrices $V_{ij}$ are given by
# ```math
#    V_{ij} = J_iC_{ij}J_j^\dagger
# ```
# where $J$ is known as a *Jones matrix* and $ij$ denotes the baseline $ij$ with sites $i$ and $j$.
#-
# `Comrade` is highly flexible with how the Jones matrices are formed and provides several
# convenience functions that parameterize standard Jones matrices. These matrices include:
#   - [`JonesG`](@ref) which builds the set of complex gain Jones matrices
# ```math
#   G = \begin{pmatrix}
#           g_a   &0\\
#           0     &g_b\\
#       \end{pmatrix}
# ```
#   - [`JonesD`](@ref) which builds the set of complex d-terms Jones matrices
# ```math
#   D = \begin{pmatrix}
#           1   & d_a\\
#           d_b     &1\\
#       \end{pmatrix}
# ```
#   - [`JonesR`](@ref) is the basis transform matrix $T$. This transformation is special and
#      combines two things using the decomposition $T=FB$. The first, $B$, is the transformation from
#      some reference basis to the observed coherency basis (this allows for mixed basis measurements).
#      The second is the feed rotation, $F$, that transforms from some reference axis to the axis of the
#      telescope as the source moves in the sky. The feed rotation matrix `F` for circular feeds
#      in terms of the per station feed rotation angle $\varphi$ is
# ```math
#   F = \begin{pmatrix}
#           e^{-i\varphi}   & 0\\
#           0     & e^{i\varphi}\\
#       \end{pmatrix}
# ```
#-
#
#  In the rest of the tutorial, we are going to solve for all of these instrument model terms on
#  in addition to our image structure to reconstruct a polarized image of a synthetic dataset.

# ##Building the Model/Posterior


# To build the model, we first break it down into two parts:
#    1. **The image or sky model**. In Comrade, all polarized image models are written in terms of the Stokes parameters.
#       In this tutorial, we will use a polarized image model based on Pesce (2021)[^2], and
#       parameterizes each pixel in terms of the [`Poincare sphere`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unpolarized_light#Poincar%C3%A9_sphere).
#       This parameterization ensures that we have all the physical properties of stokes parameters.
#       Note that we also have a parameterization in terms of hyperbolic trig functions `VLBISkyModels.PolExp2Map`
#    2. **The instrument model**. The instrument model specifies the model that describes the impact of instrumental and atmospheric effects.
#       We will be using the $J = GDR$ decomposition we described above. However, to parameterize the
#       R/L complex gains, we will be using a gain product and ratio decomposition. The reason for this decomposition
#       is that in realistic measurements, the gain ratios and products have different temporal characteristics.
#       Namely, many of the EHT observations tend to demonstrate constant R/L gain ratios across an
#       nights observations, compared to the gain products, which vary every scan. Additionally,
#       the gain ratios tend to be smaller (i.e., closer to unity) than the gain products.
#       Using this apriori knowledge, we can build this into our model and reduce
#       the total number of parameters we need to model.


# First we specify our sky model. As always `Comrade` requires this to be a two argument
# function where the first argument is typically a NamedTuple of parameters we will fit
# and the second are additional metadata required to build the model.
using StatsFuns: logistic
function sky(θ, metadata)
    (;c, σ, p, p0, pσ, angparams) = θ
    (;ftot, grid) = metadata
    ## Build the stokes I model
    rast = ftot*to_simplex(CenteredLR(), σ.*c.params)
    ## The total polarization fraction is modeled in logit space so we transform it back
    pim = logistic.(p0 .+ pσ.*p.params)
    ## Build our IntensityMap
    pmap = PoincareSphere2Map(rast, pim, angparams, grid)
    ## Construct the actual image model which uses a third order B-spline pulse
    m = ContinuousImage(pmap, BSplinePulse{3}())
    ## Finally find the image centroid and shift it to be at the center
    x0, y0 = centroid(pmap)
    ms = shifted(m, -x0, -y0)
    return ms
end






# Now, we define the model metadata required to build the model.
# We specify our image grid and cache model needed to define the polarimetric
# image model. Our image will be a 10x10 raster with a 60μas FOV.
using Distributions, DistributionsAD
using VLBIImagePriors
fovx = μas2rad(60.0)
fovy = μas2rad(60.0)
nx = 10
ny = floor(Int, fovy/fovx*nx)
grid = imagepixels(fovx, fovy, nx, ny)

# For the image metadata we specify the grid and the total flux of the image, which is 1.0.
# Note that we specify the total flux out front since it is degenerate with an overall shift
# in the gain amplitudes.
skymeta = (;ftot=1.0, grid)


# For our image prior we will use a simpler prior than
#   - We use a Dirichlet prior, `ImageDirichlet`, with unit concentration for our stokes I image pixels, `c`.
#   - For the total polarization fraction, `p`, we assume an uncorrelated uniform prior `ImageUniform` for each pixel.
#   - To specify the orientation of the polarization, `angparams`, on the Poincare sphere,
#     we use a uniform spherical distribution, `ImageSphericalUniform`.

dρ = truncated(InverseGamma(1.0, -log(0.1)*rat); lower=2.0, upper=max(nx, ny))
cprior = HierarchicalPrior(cmarkov, dρ)


# For all the calibration parameters, we use a helper function `CalPrior` which builds the
# prior given the named tuple of station priors and a `JonesCache`
# that specifies the segmentation scheme. For the gain products, we use the `scancache`, while
# for every other quantity, we use the `trackcache`.
fwhmfac = 2.0*sqrt(2.0*log(2.0))
skyprior = (

    pσ =  truncated(Normal(0.0, 1.0); lower=0.01),
    angparams = ImageSphericalUniform(nx, ny),
    )

skym = SkyModel(sky, skyprior, grid; metadata=skymeta)


# Now we build the instrument model. Due to the complexity of VLBI the instrument model is critical
# to the success of imaging and getting reliable results. For this example we will use the standard
# instrument model used in polarized EHT analyses expressed in the RIME formalism. Our Jones
# decomposition will be given by `GDR`, where `G` are the complex gains, `D` are the d-terms, and `R`
# is what we call the *ideal instrument response*, which is how an ideal interferometer using the
# feed basis we observe relative to some reference basis.
#
# Given the possible flexibility in different parameterizations of the individual Jones matrices
# each Jones matrix requires the user to specify a function that converts from parameters
# to specific parameterization f the jones matrices.

# For the complex gain matrix, we used the `JonesG` jones matrix. The first argument is now
# a function that converts from the parameters to the complex gain matrix. In this case, we
# will use a amplitude and phase decomposition of the complex gain matrix. Note that since
# the gain matrix is a diagonal 2x2 matrix the function must return a 2-element tuple.
# The first element of the tuple is the gain for the first polarization feed (R) and the
# second is the gain for the second polarization feed (L).
G = JonesG() do x
    gR = exp(x.lgR + 1im*x.gpR)
    gL = gR*exp(x.lgrat + 1im*x.gprat)
    return gR, gL
end
# Note that we are using the Julia `do` syntax here to define an anonymous function. This
# could've also been written as
# ```julia
# fgain(x) = (exp(x.lgR + 1im*x.gpR), exp(x.lgR + x.lgrat + 1im*(x.gpR + x.gprat)))
# G = JonesG(fgain)
# ```


# Similarly we provide a `JonesD` function for the leakage terms. Since we assume that we
# are in the small leakage limit, we will use the decomposition
# 1 d1
# d2 1
# Therefore, there are 2 free parameters for the JonesD our parameterization function
# must return a 2-element tuple. For d-terms we will use a re-im parameterization.
D = JonesD() do x
    dR = complex(x.dRx, x.dRy)
    dL = complex(x.dLx, x.dLy)
    return dR, dL
end

# Finally we define our response Jones matrix. This matrix is a basis transform matrix
# plus the feed rotation angle for each station. These are typically set by the telescope
# so there are no free parameters, so no parameterization is necessary.
R = JonesR(;add_fr=true)

# Finally, we build our total Jones matrix by using the `JonesSandwich` function. The
# first argument is a function that specifies how to combine each Jones matrix. In this case,
# we are completely standard so we just need to multiply the different jones matrices.
# Note that if no function is provided, the default is to multiply the Jones matrices,
# so we could've removed the splat(*) argument in this case.
J = JonesSandwich(splat(*), G, D, R)

# sampling.

# ## Reconstructing the Image and Instrument Effects

# To sample from this posterior, it is convenient to move from our constrained parameter space
# to an unconstrained one (i.e., the support of the transformed posterior is (-∞, ∞)). This transformation is
# done using the `asflat` function.

#     angular variables, where we often artificially increase the dimension
#     of the parameter space to make sampling easier.

# Now we optimize. Unlike other imaging examples, we move straight to gradient optimizers
# due to the higher dimension of the space. In addition the only AD package that can currently
# work with the polarized Comrade posterior is Zygote. Note that in the future we expect to
# shift entirely to Enzyme, and in fact large portions of Comrade's AD already uses Enzyme
# through custom rules.
